**Reminders**
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Please also remember that you will want to use the console to "try out" code to get it working. Once you get it working, copy the code that worked (not the results) over into a code chunk in your rmd.  Remember that the code within your rmd file has to be self-contained and include all the steps -- your rmd file will not "remember" what you did on your own in the console. When you click knit, it can only execute the code that was present in the rmd. Do not copy the results from your console into your RMD file. In addition, do not include large amounts of output in your writeup (i.e. don't print full datasets to the screen).

Include both the code to get your answer and your answer in words.

It is best to work will small amounts of code at a time: get some code working, copy it into the rmd as a code chunk, write your text answer (outside the code chunk) if needed, and check that the file will still knit properly. Do not proceed to answer more questions until you get the first bit working. If you knit everytime you try to write some new code, you'll know where the error is (in the last thing you did!) This will save you huge headaches. 

Although the questions break up each task for you into parts, remember that you might need to put a bunch of code together into a single chunk to make it work. For example, if you create a density plot in one part of a question, and want to add the mean value to it as a line in another part, you need these two commands to follow one another in the same chunk of code.

Some tips: Start early, work with friends in the class, use the discussion forum, come to class and section, go to office hours if you need to, read the textbook and other readings -- do all these things and you'll succeed! Good luck.

## Question 1: Read Experiment Research Paper (2 points)

Read the article, "Social Pressure and Voter Turnout: Evidence from a Large-Scale Field Experiment" by Gerber, Green & Larimer, posted on Gauchospace last week.

**(1a)** The researchers have a main finding that we discussed in lecture. For this main finding, what is their independent variable? What is their dependent variable? For these variables, state the researchers' null and alternative hypotheses. Given this is an experiment, what's another term for our independent variable in this context? *(0.5 pts.)*

**(1b)** Examine Table 1. Describe what this table is showing the reader. After looking at this table, should the researchers be including any control variables in their regression model? Why or why not? *(0.5 pts.)*

**(1c)** Examine Table 2. What is the average treatment effect of the "self" treatment? How would you calculate this? *(0.5 pts.)*

**(1d)** Examine Table 3. Interpret the third coefficient (middle left cell) in terms of its statistical and substantive significance using the substantive meanings of the IV and DV. How does this coefficient change if the authors include covariates in their model? What does this tell us about their research findings? Would you say this is a causal estimate -- why or why not? *(0.5 pts.)*


## Question 2: Assassinations Data (4 points)

One longstanding debate in the study of international relations concerns the question of whether individual political leaders can make a difference. Some emphasize that leaders with different ideologies and personalities can significantly affect the course of a nation. Others argue that political leaders are severely constrained by historical and institutional forces. Did individuals like Hitler, Mao, Roosevelt, and Churchill make a big difference? The difficulty of empirically testing these arguments stems from the fact that the change of leadership is not random and there are many confounding factors to be adjusted for.

In this exercise, we consider a natural experiment where the success or failure of assassination attempts is assumed to be essentially random. Each observation of the data set `leaders.Rdata` contains information about an assassination attempt. Below are the names and descriptions of variables in this leader assassination data set. The polity variable documents and quantifies the regime types of all countries in the world from 1800. The polity score is a 21-point scale ranging from −10 (hereditary monarchy) to 10 (consolidated democracy). In this data set, the result variable is a 10 category factor variable describing the result of each assassination attempt. These are the other variables:

Variable Name  | Description 
------------- | ------------- 
country | country
year | year
leadername | the name of leader who was targeted 
age | the age of targeted leader
politybefore | average polity score of country over 3 years prior to the attempt
polityafter | average polity score of country over the 3 years after the attempt
civilwarbefore | 1 if country is in civil war during 3 years prior to the attempt, 0 otherwise
civilwarafter | 1 if country is in civil war during 3 years after the attempt, 0 otherwise
interwarbefore | 1 if country is in international war during 3 years prior to the attempt, 0 otherwise
interwarafter | 1 if country is in international war during 3 years after the attempt, 0 otherwise
result | the result of assassination attempt

As usual, set your working directory and load the data.

**(2a)** Descriptive statistics: What is your sample size? How many assassination attempts are recorded in the data? How many countries experience at least two leader assassination attempts? (The `unique()` function, which returns a set of unique values from the input vector, may be useful here). What is the average number of assassination attempts (per year) among countries that have experienced at least one assassination? *(0.5 pts.)*

**(2b)** Create a new binary variable named success that is equal to 1 if a leader dies from the attack and to 0 if the leader survives, using the `levels()` and `ifelse()` functions from lecture 9. Store this new variable as part of the original data frame. What is the overall success rate of leader assassination? *(0.5 pts.)*

**(2c)** Investigate whether the average polity score over 3 years *after* to an assassination attempt differs on average between successful and failed attempts. Briefly interpret the results in light of the validity of the aforementioned assumption. *(1 pt.)*

**(2d)** Does successful leader assassination cause democratization? Answer this question by running a regression that controls for past experience. Interpret the results, and state your assumptions vis-a-vis causation. *(1 pt.)*

**(2e)** You want to know whether it matters how old the person was when the assassination attempt occurred mattered in terms of the likelihood of the assassination being successful. Using the tools learned in this course, examine whether this is the case and interpret your results. What does this say about your assumption of random assignment? *(1 pt.)*


## Question 3: Causes of Corruption (4 points)

In an article in *Comparative Political Studies*, “Institutions and the resource curse: Evidence from cases of oil-related bribery,” Prof. Mahdavi examines possible determinants of prosecuted corruption across oil-rich countries. The dataset  is `oil-corruption.Rdata` and below is an abbreviated list of the variables.

Variable Name  | Description 
------------- | ------------- 
bribes | amount of oil-related bribery caught by the Department of Justice in a given country, measured in dollars.
lbribes | logged version of the bribes variable.
NOC | 1 if the country has a regulatory national oil company (NOC), 0 otherwise.
GDP | logged GDP per capita.
Oil | logged oil income per capita.
Polity | polity score, ranging from -10 to +10.
PressFreedom | Freedom of the Press score, ranging from 0 (least restrictions on free press) to 100 (most restrictions on free press).
Population | logged population.
UN | United Nations voting alignment, measuring how often the country votes with the USA at the UN General Assembly.

As usual, set your working directory and load the data.

**(3a)** Descriptive statistics: Explore the regulatory NOC variable. What kind of variable is this? What is this variable's maximum and minimum? What is the mean level of NOC? What is the standard deviation? Create a histogram to show how this variable is distributed and substantively interpret what this plot tells you about how the distribution of regulatory NOCs across countries. *(1 pt.)*

**(3b)** You want to understand what predicts bribery across oil-rich countries. What is the difference of means in bribery (using the variable `bribes`) across countries with and without a regulatory NOC? *(1 pt.)*

**(3c)** Run a regression to predict **logged bribery**, using NOC, GDP, Polity, Population, and PressFreedom. (Remember, variables are case sensitive in R.) Interpret your results in terms of statistical significance. Which factors seem to be associated with increased corruption? What is your model R-squared? Why does your degrees of freedom drop after running your model? *(1 pt.)*

**(3d)** It could be that oil is a potential cause of corruption: i.e., that countries with more oil are likely to be more corrupt. One proxy for oil wealth is oil income per capita. What happens if you add the Oil variable to your model? What does this say about the relationship between oil and corruption? *(1 pt.)*
